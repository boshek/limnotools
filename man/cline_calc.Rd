\title{Calculate cline of series of segments}
\usage{
cline_calc(z_seg = z_seg, sigma_seg = sigma_seg)
}
\arguments{
\item{z_seg}{depth in metres; should be an increasing vector}

\item{sigma_seg}{parameter measured in the water column profile}
}
\value{
the depth of the cline
}
\description{
Cline depth is defined as the midpoint of the segment connecting inflection points that has the maximum slope. A cline cannot occur over a depth range of less than 1m and also cannot be the shallowest segment. Violating both conditions will thrown warnings though this function handles both differently. Used mostly with \code{wtr_layer}
