#' SUBROUTINE s_m_p(n,eps,x,y,Nr,Ni)
#' C     Main subroutine for determining LINEAR SEGMENTS for a SPECIFIED ERROR NORM VALUE
#' c     (This subroutine determines the linear fit to the data for a specified error norm)
#' C     Input:
#' C          N   -[INTEGER] number of data points;
#' C          EPS -[REAL]    error norm;
#' C          X   -[REAL(N)] input x-axis data array, should be increasing function of index
#' C          Y   -[REAL(N)] input y-axis data array
#' C       Output:
#' C          NR  -[INTEGER] final number of segments;
#' C          NI  -[INTEGER] final array with segment start points
#' C
#' INTEGER NR, NI(n)
#' REAL X(n),Y(n)

# The dynamic arrays in R remove the need to know the number of data points, n, which is just
# the length of x and y. Similarly Nr is no longer needed and is length(Ni)-1, one less than the length
# of the output array.

    # If the end index of any interval is only 1 greater than the start index
    # (i.e., ni[i+1] == 1 + ni[i]) then bump the end index up by one. Due to the
