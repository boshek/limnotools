#' @description  Cline depth is defined as the midpoint of the segment connecting inflection points that has the maximum slope. A cline cannot occur over a depth range of less than 1m and also cannot be the shallowest segment. Violating both conditions will thrown warnings though this function handles both differently. Used mostly with \code{wtr_layer}
