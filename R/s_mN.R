#' Subroutine to determine the Linear SEGMENTS for a PREDEFINED NUMBER OF SEGMENTS (NR)
#' (Use this program when you want to predefine the number of segments you want to fit
#' to the data)
#' Segments the data in x,y into the intervals given in the output array A.
#' The data in each interval can be linearly fitted within an error, given by r2b(), less than eps.
#' Comments from original Fortran code:
#' SUBROUTINE s_mN(n,eps,x,y,Nr,Ni)
#' C       Input:
#' C          N   -[INTEGER] number of points;
#' C          NR  -[INTEGER] number of segments (fixed);
#' C          X   -[REAL(N)] input x data array, should be increasing function of index
#' C          Y   -[REAL(N)] input y data array
#' C       Output:
#' C        EPS -[REAL] maximum error norm
#' C          NI  -[INTEGER] final array with segment start points
#' INTEGER NR, NI(n)
#' REAL X(n),Y(n)

# The dynamic arrays in R remove the need to know the number of data points, n, which is just
# the length of x and y.

s_mN = function(nr,x,y) {

  # Initially spread intervals uniformly out over the data
  # taking care that the last interval includes the last point,
  # which otherwise might be lost due to the rounding error.
  ni = rep(0,nr+1)
  m = round(length(x)/nr)
  ni = c( m*(0:(nr-1))+1, length(x)+1 )

  #TODO: A more accurate formula might be:
  # ni = round( 1 + (0:nr)*length(x)/nr )

  #  Nr=2
  #      m=NINT(FLOAT(N)/FLOAT(Nr))
  #        ni(1)=1
  #      DO i=2,Nr
  #        Ni(i)=m*(i-1)+1
  #      end DO

    changed = FALSE  # Continue the loop only if something changed.

    # All intervals now meet the test but it is possible that there are too many
    # in the sense that there may now be adjacent intervals, which if merged into one,
    # will then still meet the test.
    # Scan for such interval pairs and merge them.

    # # Note that ni potentially changes inside the loop.

    #   # if the start value is greater than the limit value but R runs backward.

    #     k1=ni[i-1]
    #     k2=ni[i+1]

    #     if( eps1<eps ) {
    #       if( length(ni)-1 > 2 ) { # Are there two or more intervals in the entire set?
    #         # Yes, so merge the interval we are looking at.
    #         ni <- merge_intervals(i, ni)
    #         changed = TRUE

    #       } else {
    #         # We are here because the last two intervals tested out to merge.
    #         # So we can just adjust the intervals and bail out entirely because,
    #         # apparently the entire data set lies on a line within eps!
    #         # TODO: The original code doesn't seem to do this correctly. It should
    #         # adjust ni[2] = ni[3] and nr = 1. I think this branch has never been
    #         # taken in actual operation. Obviously the data set is invalid if it lies
    #         # entirely on a straight line, right?
    #
    #         ni[1]=1  # TODO: Original code, but this should already be the case.

    # # If a merge was done then changed==TRUE. In this circumstance, the original
    # # code then immediately attempts to merge all intervals again from 2 so we
    # # do the same. This procedure seems wasteful because all the prior
    # # interval pairs have already been tested for merging and don't need it, yet we
    # # are going to test them all over again. For the moment we will continue to
    # # do it this way and perhaps TODO change it later so that it just restarts
    # # with the just-merged interval. Should get the same results faster.
    #
    # if( changed ) next   # short out the rest of the while(changed) loop.

    # In the original code the following is preceded with a comment:
    #  "to avoid couples"
    # I'm not precisely sure what that is supposed to mean but from the original
    # code I infer:
    #
    # If the end index of any interval is only 1 greater than the start index
    # (i.e., ni[i+1] == ni[i]) then bump the end index up by one. Due to the
    # loop this change propagates up to the last interval so we can't easily
    # replace the loop with nice vectorized R code.

    for( i in 1:(length(ni)-1) ) {
      if( ni[i+1] - ni[i] == 1 ) {
        ni[i+1] = ni[i+1] + 1
        changed = TRUE
      }
    }

    # TODO: seems like we should restart the while(changed) loop at this point.

    # At this point in the original code stands the comment:
    #  "{"R" algorithm: adjusting of endpoint}"
    # I don't know what the "R algorithm" is so I'm just going to have to wing
    # comments.

    for( i in 2:(length(ni)-1) ) {
      k1 = ni[i-1]
      kmid = ni[i]
      k2 = ni[i+1]

      j1 = ni[i]
      for( j in (k1+2):(k2-2) ) {
        epsr = max( r2b(k1,j,x,y), r2b(j,k2,x,y) )

      # but epsm1 is never used so we have ignored it.

  # The following statement corresponds to one in the original code but seems
  # unnecessary. The code that manipulates ni should really maintain this condition.
  # Mind you, I haven't actually checked carefully that this is true. Maybe the
  # author added it to solve a problem! TODO: maybe take it out and test sometime.
